# Forge Settings

## Quick Start

**Don't manually edit these files!** Use the Setup Wizard instead:

1. Open Unity
2. Go to **GameLabs → Forge → Setup Wizard**
3. Follow the wizard to configure your settings

## How Settings Work

### API Key Storage (User-Specific)

Your **OpenAI API key** is stored in **EditorPrefs** (not in any file). This means:
- ✅ Your API key is never included when exporting .unitypackage files
- ✅ Your API key is never committed to Git
- ✅ Each team member uses their own API key
- ✅ No accidental sharing of credentials

### Game Settings (Project-Specific)

Other settings like game name, model selection, and generation preferences are stored in `forge.config.json`:
- ✅ Can be committed to Git (no sensitive data)
- ✅ Shared across your team
- ✅ Safe to include in .unitypackage exports

## Files in This Folder

- **forge.config.json** - Your project's configuration (auto-generated by Setup Wizard)
- **forge.config.template.json** - Template file (for reference only)
- **forge.stats.json** - Usage statistics (auto-generated, in .gitignore)

## For Package Developers

If you're **creating a .unitypackage** to share with others:

1. The `forge.config.json` file will be included (without API keys)
2. Users will need to run the Setup Wizard to add their own API key
3. This is the intended behavior - keeps credentials secure!

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing API Key" Error

Run the Setup Wizard: **GameLabs → Forge → Setup Wizard**

### Need to Change Settings

Go to: **GameLabs → Forge → Settings**

### Lost Your API Key

The API key is stored in Unity's EditorPrefs. If you need to reset it, just run the Setup Wizard again.

## Technical Details

For developers who want to understand the implementation:

- API keys are stored in `EditorPrefs` with key: `GameLabs.Forge.OpenAIKey`
- Config file path: `Assets/GameLabs/Forge/Settings/forge.config.json`
- The `openaiApiKey` field in the JSON is ignored (kept for backwards compatibility)
- To programmatically access the API key: `ForgeConfig.GetOpenAIKey()`
- To set the API key: `ForgeConfig.SetOpenAIKey(string)`
